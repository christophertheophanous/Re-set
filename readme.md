### 1. Install Glyphshanger

````
npm install -g glyphhanger
````
Install Python 3: (maybe you ned to install homebrew first)
````
brew install python3
````
Install fontTools using pip:
`````
pip3 install fonttools
`````
Install Brotli and Zopfli using pip: (nesessary to generate compressed WOFF/2 files)

````
pip3 install brotli
pip3 install zopfli
````
### 2. Use Glyphshanger

Make new folder with only the *.ttf you want to convert

Then:
````
cd /path/to/folder/
````
````
glyphhanger –subset=*.ttf
````

`glyphhanger` also generates WOFF2 files for Variable fonts. The file size of the subsetted Variable Inter WOFF2 file generated by glyphhanger is slightly smaller than the file size generated by Google’s woff2 library (302KB compared to 308KB). It does not break the Variable axes of the font like other online tools might, so it is safe to use.
